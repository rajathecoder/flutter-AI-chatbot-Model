# Flutter & Dart Teaching Chatbot: Architecture Design

This document outlines the proposed architecture for the Python-based chatbot designed to teach the Flutter framework and the Dart programming language.

## 1. Core Components

The chatbot will consist of the following primary components:

*   **User Interface (UI) / Interaction Layer:** This component handles communication with the user. Initially, this could be a simple command-line interface (CLI) or integrated into a basic web interface later. It receives user input and displays the chatbot's responses.
*   **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Responsible for processing the user's natural language input. Its tasks include intent recognition (e.g., asking a question, requesting an explanation, asking for an example) and entity extraction (e.g., identifying specific Flutter widgets, Dart concepts, or keywords).
*   **Dialog Management:** Manages the conversation flow. It keeps track of the conversation state, decides the next action based on the NLU output and conversation history, and orchestrates calls to the knowledge base and response generation components.
*   **Knowledge Base Interface:** Provides access to the curated Flutter and Dart knowledge. This component will retrieve relevant information based on the user's query or the dialog manager's request.
*   **Response Generation (NLG):** Constructs the chatbot's response in natural language, incorporating information retrieved from the knowledge base and guided by the dialog manager.

## 2. Technology Stack (Python)

Given the requirement for a Python implementation, the following libraries and technologies are considered:

*   **NLU:** Libraries like `spaCy` or `NLTK` can be used for basic text processing, intent classification, and entity recognition. For more advanced NLU, a framework like `Rasa NLU` could be employed, or potentially leveraging pre-trained language models for intent/entity tasks if feasible.
*   **Dialog Management:** A simple state machine implemented in Python could manage basic conversational flows initially. For more complex interactions and context management, `Rasa Core` or a custom implementation might be necessary.
*   **Knowledge Base:** The curated information (official docs, concepts, tutorials identified in `data_sources.md`) will form the knowledge base. A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach is highly recommended. This involves:
    *   **Document Processing:** Parsing the gathered Markdown files (`flutter_concepts.md`, `dart_concepts.md`) and potentially scraping/processing the official documentation URLs.
    *   **Vector Store:** Using libraries like `FAISS`, `ChromaDB`, or `LanceDB` to store vector embeddings of the knowledge base chunks.
    *   **Embedding Model:** Utilizing sentence transformers (e.g., from the `sentence-transformers` library) or other embedding models to convert text chunks and user queries into vectors for similarity search.
    *   **Retrieval:** Implementing logic to retrieve the most relevant document chunks based on the user's query vector.
*   **Response Generation:** Combining retrieved information with prompt engineering techniques using a capable Large Language Model (LLM) accessed via an API (if available/permissible within the project constraints) or a locally run model. Alternatively, simpler template-based responses combined with retrieved text can be used for a less sophisticated version.
*   **Core Framework:** Python 3.11+.

## 3. Knowledge Representation & Retrieval

The knowledge gathered in Step 1 (official docs, tutorials, key concepts) will be processed and stored for efficient retrieval:

1.  **Chunking:** Documents (Markdown files, scraped web content) will be split into smaller, manageable chunks (e.g., paragraphs or sections).
2.  **Embedding:** Each chunk will be converted into a numerical vector representation using a suitable embedding model.
3.  **Indexing:** These vectors will be stored in a vector database, indexed for fast similarity search.
4.  **Retrieval:** When a user asks a question, the query will be embedded, and the vector database will be searched for the most semantically similar chunks. These relevant chunks are then passed to the response generation stage.

## 4. Teaching Capabilities & Strategy

The chatbot will employ several strategies to facilitate learning:

*   **Q&A:** Answering specific questions about Flutter widgets, Dart syntax, concepts, and common errors using the RAG approach.
*   **Concept Explanation:** Providing clear, concise explanations of core Flutter and Dart concepts, drawing from the `flutter_concepts.md`, `dart_concepts.md`, and official documentation.
*   **Code Examples:** Presenting relevant, simple code snippets to illustrate concepts or syntax. These can be extracted from documentation or generated.
*   **Guided Learning (Potential Future Feature):** Offering structured paths through topics, potentially mimicking tutorials or codelabs.
*   **Clarification & Scaffolding:** Asking clarifying questions if the user's query is ambiguous and breaking down complex topics into smaller parts.

## 5. User Interaction Flow (Example)

1.  **User:** "What is a StatefulWidget in Flutter?"
2.  **Chatbot (NLU):** Intent: `request_explanation`, Entity: `StatefulWidget`.
3.  **Chatbot (Dialog Manager):** Query Knowledge Base for `StatefulWidget` explanation.
4.  **Chatbot (KB Interface - RAG):** Embed query, search vector store, retrieve relevant chunks about StatefulWidget definition, lifecycle, and use cases.
5.  **Chatbot (Response Generation):** Synthesize an explanation using retrieved chunks: "A StatefulWidget is a widget in Flutter that can change its appearance in response to user interactions or data changes. Unlike StatelessWidgets, they have an associated State object that holds mutable state and defines the `build()` method... Would you like to see a simple example?"
6.  **User:** "Yes, show me an example."
7.  **Chatbot (NLU):** Intent: `request_example`, Entity: `StatefulWidget`.
8.  **Chatbot (Dialog Manager):** Query Knowledge Base for `StatefulWidget` example code.
9.  **Chatbot (KB Interface - RAG):** Retrieve relevant code snippet chunks.
10. **Chatbot (Response Generation):** Present formatted code snippet with brief explanation.

## 6. Training/Customization Strategy

The primary "training" involves building the knowledge base:

*   **Data Ingestion:** Processing the collected Markdown files and potentially scraping/parsing official documentation.
*   **Embedding & Indexing:** Creating and storing vector embeddings for the processed data.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** Designing effective prompts for the LLM (if used in RAG) to generate accurate and pedagogically sound explanations based on retrieved context.
*   **Evaluation (Manual):** Regularly testing the chatbot with sample questions and evaluating the relevance and accuracy of its responses, refining the retrieval or generation process as needed.

This architecture provides a foundation for a knowledgeable and helpful teaching chatbot, leveraging the authoritative resources gathered previously.
